## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview

FinSight is designed with a classic **layered architecture**, promoting a clean separation of concerns and making the application easy to test, maintain, and scale.

* **Controller Layer**: The entry point for all API requests, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses and delegating business logic to the service layer.
* **Service Layer**: Contains the core business logic of the application. It is divided into interfaces (`abstractclass`) and implementations (`implclass`) to promote loose coupling and easy testing.
* **Repository Layer**: The data access layer, built using Spring Data JPA. It provides a clean abstraction over the database, allowing for easy data manipulation.
* **Domain Model**: A rich domain model with JPA entities (`model`) that accurately represent the core concepts of the application.
* **DTO Layer**: A dedicated layer of Data Transfer Objects (`payload`) to ensure a clean separation between the internal domain model and the external API, preventing data leakage and providing a stable API contract.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **JDK 21** or newer
* **Maven 3.9** or newer
* A modern IDE such as **IntelliJ IDEA** or **VS Code**

### Installation & Execution

## üåê Future Architecture: Microservices

As FinSight grows in complexity and user base, transitioning from a monolithic architecture to a **microservices architecture** will be crucial for scalability, resilience, and maintainability. This will involve breaking down the application into smaller, independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business capability.

### Proposed Microservices

* **Authentication Service**: A dedicated service for managing user authentication, registration, and JWT generation.
* **User Profile Service**: Manages user profiles, including personal information and preferences.
* **Expense Management Service**: Handles all aspects of expense tracking, including individual and recurring expenses.
* **Budgeting Service**: Manages the creation, tracking, and analysis of budgets.
* **Group Service**: Manages group expenses, members, and shared financial data.
* **Analytics & Reporting Service**: Powers the dashboard and generates financial reports and insights.
* **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users about budget alerts, upcoming recurring expenses, and other important events.

### Microservices Ecosystem Technologies

* **API Gateway**: A single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice. **Spring Cloud Gateway** would be an excellent choice.
* **Service Discovery**: Allows services to find and communicate with each other dynamically. **Eureka** or **Consul** can be used for this purpose.
* **Configuration Management**: Centralizes configuration for all microservices. **Spring Cloud Config** provides a robust solution.
* **Inter-Service Communication**:
    * **Synchronous**: REST APIs or gRPC for direct service-to-service communication.
    * **Asynchronous**: A message broker like **RabbitMQ** or **Apache Kafka** for event-driven communication, promoting loose coupling and resilience.
* **Containerization & Orchestration**: **Docker** for containerizing each microservice and **Kubernetes** for orchestrating and managing the containerized applications, ensuring high availability and scalability.
* **Monitoring & Logging**: A centralized logging and monitoring solution, such as the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Prometheus and Grafana**, to provide visibility into the health and performance of the microservices ecosystem.

This microservices approach will enable FinSight to evolve into a highly scalable, resilient, and flexible platform, capable of supporting a large and active user base.
